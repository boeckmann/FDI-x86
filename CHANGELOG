# Change Log

    The FDI-x86 change log only covers the FreeDOS Installer Floppy Edition.
    It does not cover any of the tools used by the installer or any of the
    programs installed by FDI-x86.

## FreeDOS 1.3-Final

	Startup Language Selection
	Rework installer initialization
	Only runs on FreeCOM now. Does not Reload Shell on another OS. Without a
		memory manager being loaded, it used to much memory and would cause
		pass-through decompression issues.

## FDI-x86 1.3-RC5

	Changed default install directory from FDOS to FREEDOS
    Loosened license statement to permit any GPL version for ALL installer files.
    Added usage of FDBANNER.COM to boot process.
    Removed V8PT generated FreeDOS boot banner.
    People like change logs. So, I started one for FDI-x86. :-)

## FDI-x86 1.3-RC4

    With the release of FreeDOS 1.3-RC4, several different diskette size copies
    of installation media for FDI-x86 were released. Also, it was used to
    provide an "easter-egg" alternative install method on the LiveCD.

## FDI-x86 1.3-RC3

    Starting with FreeDOS v1.3-RC3, an initial version of FDI-x86 was included
    with the standard release media.
